How to scroll down the page?

We use javaScriptExecutor interface to scroll down the page.
Along with javascript command.

2 ways to scroll:
	#1 -> scroll down or up to certain pixel number
	#2 -> scrollToView -> scroll to a certain web element

	Syntax:

First cast webdriver to JavascriptExecutor interface
Then call execute script method.

========================================

Actions class in Selenium:

- Actions class is used for advanced mouse and keyboard actions using Selenium
- Like double click, hover over an element, right click, drag drop, etc
- Press keyUp or keyDown on the keyboard etc.

When doing test automation, at some steps, we will need to perform advanced actions to simulate user.

How to use Actions class?

	#1 -> Create object of Actions class and pass the driver to constructor
		Actions actions = new Actions(driver);

	#2 -> call the required method or methods for a particular webelement or in general

	#3 -> add perform() or build().perform() at the end


Some actions we can do using Actions class:

Actions actions = new Actions(driver);

Hover over and element:

actions.moveToElement(elem).perform();

Click and hold action:

actions.clickAndHold(elem).perform()

actions.dragAndDrop().perform()

actions.doubleClick().perform()

actions.contextClick().perform()

add new class ActionsDemoTest

hover.url=http://practice.cybertekschool.com/hovers
=======================

WebElement img1 = driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//img)[1]"));

//create Actions class object to be able to hover over image
Actions actions = new Actions(driver);

//hover over img1
actions.moveToElement(img1).perform();

In above code, we are locating the image on the page.
Then creating object of Actions class to be able to hover over.
We are calling moveToElement(img1) method to hover over the img1 webelement.

perform() method needs to be added at the end to actually Perform/Run the moveToElement or other action
