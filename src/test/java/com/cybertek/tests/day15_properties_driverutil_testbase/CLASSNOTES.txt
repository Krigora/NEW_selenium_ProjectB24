Sunday, Test Automation Day 15.

Webtables handling in selenium.
Xpath techniques for handling web tables

------------------

Properties file in java.

property -> is key + value format data. Similar to map format in data structures.

appName=vytrack
adminUserName=admin
adminPassword=abc321

properties file in very popular file in java development and automation projects. We store important properties/info regarding your application or configuration.

Lets take an example of URLs that we have been using so far.
All urls that we used are inside our code assigned to a variable.

String url = "http://practice.cybertekschool.com/tables";

The above approach is called HARD CODING the value.
Hard coding:
	-> it is keeping data/test data in the source code
	-> assigning input values into variables in our code

What is wrong with that, so far it is working for us?
	Hard coding values may cause more work when it comes to re-using values, and maintaining data.
	If a value needs to change, we will need to dig though our code to update everywhere.

How do we use properties file?

In test automation, we store our application Test data into a seperate file that is outside our code.
Data can be : urls, credentials, environment settings, browser settings, timeouts, database urls, api urls etc

===================

2 Types of Properties in java:
	-> built in properties
	-> properties that programmer defines in configuration.properties file


built in properties are avaible in any computer and we read those using System.getPropety("prop.name") command

EX:
System.out.println(System.getProperty("os.name")); MacOS
System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name")); CybertekB22
......
Built in properties are built into a System, so they are available anywhere in your code.

--------------

For custom properties , we need to add a new file with extension .propeties then type our data in key=value format.

configuration.propeties:

browser=chrome
env=qa
qaUrl=https://qa.vytrack.com
etc

Then we need to read values from that file using Java.
===============================

add new package day15_properties_driverutil_testbase

add new class SystemPropertiesTest

=============================

System.getProperty("prop_name"); method is used to read built in System properties values. os.name, user.name, user.dir, java.version etc

Lets add a new file into our project.
configuration.properties

Right click on your project name > new > file > configuration.properties

==========================

Where do you store your test data?

I store my automation test data into different files. Like configuration.properties file in key and value format.
My urls, credentials, browser , execution settings, test input are stored in configuration.properties file.

I do not hardcode values into my automation code.
I keep data outside the code so that I can easily maintain it and use it.

How do you read values from properties file?

I use values using java programming language and written a utility for that.
As we know properties file is like any other file and we need input stream to open it. So i open the file using
FileInputStream object.

FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("configuration.properties");

Then i load it to a Properties object.

Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.load(fis);

Then use getProperty("key name") method to read values from the file.

String url = properties.getProperty("url");
driver.get(url);

------
java.io package -> java Input / Output package.
java.nio -> java NEW input/output package

FileInputStream class is used to read files using java.

Scanner class can also be used to read file.

INPUT -> reading from files
OUTPUT -> writing to files
-------

Since we will be using properties file to store and read values in our automation framework.
We need some utility class to read values more effectively and easily.

ConfigurationReader in utils package

---------

static variable -> variable belongs to class, it is shared with only one copy. This variable is accessible by static methods

static method -> can be called using the classname.methodname or using object. It can access only other static variables and methods.

static block -> it is a block code that runs ONCE when class is loaded/used. We can add code that needs to run once ONLY.

static inner/nested class -> class that is inside another class. do not worry about this one.

Why are we using static block in our ConfigurationReader class.

Because we want to open the properties file and load to Properties object ONLY ONCE before we read values.
